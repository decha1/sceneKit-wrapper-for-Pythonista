#Objective

Build a 3x3x3 sized cube from the available pieces. There are five typical configurations to choose from. Click on the selected puzzle box to start solving it. 

#Solver interface
Click on a piece to move it to a position above the destination cube. Touch the red spheres to rotate and the yellow cones to shift the piece. Clicking on another piece will swap the one in the middle with the newly selected shape. Touching an empty (ghosty) location clears the manipulation area.

Once a piece is in the desired posisiton in the manipulation area, tap the gray cube to drop it. If the piece fits, you can choose the next piece to work with, otherwise touching any of the spheres or cones will lift the piece back to furter adjust it. The piece last dropped can be lifted by touching the gray cube again (undo last drop), if the manipulation area is empty.

In the bottom left corner there is a `restart` button. The `?` in the bottom right corner gives you a hint about the next possible moves. If the manipulation area is empty, possible continuation pieces will be highlighted green. If there is already a selected piece in the middle, you can circle through possible positions by repeatedly tapping the `?`.

The top-right `back arrow` takes you back to the puzzle selection screen, whereas the top-left `x` closes the application.

#Camera control
You can look around the central area as well as the location of the pieces by the following gestures:

- ```Pan with one finger``` to rotate the camera around the scene

- ```Pan with two fingers``` to translate the camera on its local xy-plane

- ```Pan with three fingers``` vertically to move the the camera forward backward

- ```Double-tap``` to reset the camera

- ```Rotate with two fingers``` to roll the camera (rotate on the camera node's z-axis)

- ```Pinch``` to zoom in or zoom out (change the camera's fieldOfView)



**All puzzles can be solved, so have fun!**
